## Title: Implementation of Saved Products Page

## Context:
The application requires a feature to allow users to save products for later reference. A dedicated page is needed to display a list of saved products in a user-friendly manner.

## Decision:
Implement a Saved Products page with a list of cards representing saved products.

## Rationale:

User Engagement: Providing users with the ability to save products encourages engagement and facilitates decision-making by allowing them to curate a personalized list of items of interest.

Persistence: A dedicated page for saved products ensures that users can access their saved items across sessions, enhancing the overall user experience and promoting retention.

Organization: Having a separate page for saved products enables clear organization and easy access to saved items, reducing clutter and cognitive load for users.

Flexibility: The Saved Products page can accommodate additional features such as sorting, filtering, and batch actions, enhancing usability and providing users with greater control over their saved items.

## Implications:

Data Management: Robust data management mechanisms are required to handle saving and retrieving product data, including synchronization with backend services and local storage solutions.

User Feedback: Clear and intuitive feedback mechanisms need to be implemented to inform users of successful save actions, errors, and other relevant interactions.

Performance Optimization: Careful consideration is needed to optimize performance, especially when dealing with large numbers of saved products or frequent updates to the saved items list.

## Alternatives:

Integrated Favorites Feature: Considered, but rejected in favor of a dedicated Saved Products page to maintain a clear separation of functionality and improve scalability for potential future enhancements.

Dynamic Bookmarking: Discussed, but not chosen due to potential limitations in user interaction patterns and the desire for a more structured and organized approach to saving products.
